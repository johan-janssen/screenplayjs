SWORD, a sword, shiny, quite pointy
BUCKLER, a shield, not too big

SET MY STAGE


ACT 1
SCENE 1
SAMPSON, a man, of the house of Capulet, armed with SWORD and BUCKLER
GREGORY, a man, of the house of Capulet, armed with SWORD and BUCKLER

SAMPSON
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
GREGORY
No, for then we should be colliers.
SAMPSON
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
GREGORY
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
SAMPSON
I strike quickly, being moved.

SCENE 2
CAPULET, a man
PARIS, a man
SERVANT, a servant

CAPULET
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
PARIS
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
CAPULET
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
